## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data enthusiast who has been working with data and programming for most of his life. A physicist by education, I spent years as a data journalist and trainer. Now, I aim to help companies and nstitutions use data in practical and understandable ways. I have a soft spot for statistics and mathematics. I also love singing and woodworking. Based in Hamburg, Germany.

* ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on portfolio projects featuring data analysis, data visualization, automation, and the use of GPTs (mainly via the latest capabilities of ChatGPT's APIs). Until now, I've been using private repos, but I'm starting to polish and publish them.
* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything I can about machine learning, AI in a broader sense, how to understand and approach it using Python and LLM APIs, and how to make practical use of it.
* ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that use data, analytics, and software development to help small and medium-sized enterprises and organisations make better decisions, improve productivity, and automate boring or costly processes.
* âš¡ Fun fact: My first programming language (aside from BASIC on the C64) was Assembler on an Amiga 2000.
